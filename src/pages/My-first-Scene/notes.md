# About page

Just rendering my first 3D object with react-three-fiber

# Notes

## Canvas
Canvas is the heart of the thing.
- It setup a Scene and a Camera, the basic building blocks necessary for rendering.
- It renders our scene every frame, you do not need a traditional render-loop

## mesh
Mesh is like a container for the geometry and material needed to represent a shape in 3D.

## lights
- ambientLight illuminates the scene equally
- directionalLight it's a light source.
